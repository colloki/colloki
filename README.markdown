##Colloki

Colloki is an online platform to encourage meaningful conversations among residents of local communities. This particular instance of Colloki focusses on Blacksburg, Montgomery County and nearby communities.

Colloki is an opensource research project being developed at the [SocialComp Group](http://diggov.cs.vt.edu) at the [Center for Human-Computer Interaction](http://hci.vt.edu) in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.vt.edu) and the [Department of Communication Studies](http://www.comm.vt.edu) at Virginia Tech.

## Installation

* Create `config/database.yml` from `config/database.yml.tmpl`

* Create `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` from `config/initializers/omniauth.rb.tmpl`

* Create `config/initializers/setup_mail.rb` from `config/initializers/setup_mail.rb.tmpl`

* Currently, ruby 1.9.2 is supported. Installing RVM is recommended (http://beginrescueend.com/): `rvm install 1.9.2`

* If you are using RVM, create `.rvmrc` in the root of the project folder.
    The content of this file should look something like: `rvm use 1.9.2`

* Install the required gems: `bundle install`

* The `nokogiri` gem may have dependencies you will need to install. 
    Macports is recommended for installing the `libxml2` and `libxslt` packages.

* You will also need to install `imagemagick` for `paperclip` (if not installed). 
    You can use `homebrew`: `brew install imagemagick`

* You will also need to create and make `/public/system/images` writable:
  `mkdir -p public/system/images; chmod +wx public/system/images`

* `rake db:migrate`

## Deployment

We recommend deploying using Apache+Passenger:

* Setting up Passenger and deploying app: (http://www.modrails.com/install.html) (Follow steps 1 and 2)

* Deploying to sub URI on Apache: (http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#deploying_rails_to_sub_uri)

* Resources break if you deploy on a sub URI, how to fix that: (http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#sub_uri_deployment_uri_fix)

##Fun stuff

* Run `rake fetch[start_date, end_date]` to fetch articles for a range of dates. Both `start_date` and `end_date` are optional arguments. By default (with no arguments), `rake fetch` fetches the new articles for the day

* Configure `lib/colloki_mining_store.rb` and `lib/tasks/fetch.rake` for other sources. Currently not very suited to run for other data sources. Will fix in the future
