# Ideas, TODOs

## News

* *TODO* - Get comments from news blogs and stories    
    * Use comment RSS Feeds   

* *TODO* - Build special tools for the inaccessible but **important** local sources of news      
    * Since they are fewer in number, find a way to make them more prominent -- Separate High Level View?

## Analytics

* Using Google Analytics  

* Ability for user to vote on the usefulness / comprehensibility of a topic. Maybe two buttons, "**This topic is useful**" and "**This topic is confusing/doesn't make sense**"   

* Ability for user to report a story as irrelevant (not useful from a local perspective)  


## Twitter

* *TODO* - Archive tweets from Seungwon's server on Grumpy

* Unsupervised Topic Modeling
  * *Unsupervised Modeling of Twitter Conversations (2010)*   

            
* Supervised Topic Modeling   
    * *Characterizing Microblogs with Topic Models (2010, International AAAI Conference)*   
        * Used Labeled LDA  (*what is that?*)
        * Interviews with 4 Twitter users and Web Based survey to determine **follow behavior** on twitter  
            * Came up with *substance*, *social*, *status*, *style* (*manual labelling on the data set*)  
        * In addition, #hashtags used as labels
        * Other labels: *:)*, *:(*, *@user*, *?*

* Searching for words in existing topics to map a tweet to a topic    
    * Shot in the dark? Don't want to go ahead with this until sure -- ***time-consuming***

* Separate Upper Level (alongwith Latest and User Contributed) for Tweets?    
    * Problem: Isolated from "Topics" we discovered from news websites and blogs

    * Use **#hashtags** as topics

* Identify Twitter Leaders? (People who talk most often about Local stuff). We can filter out organizations/blogs.  
    * *TODO* - Look for existing research in this area   


* Customizable Timeline (Today, This Month, This Year)  


* Use ideas from ThinkUp?

    * Inquires (Tweets that are questions)
    * Popular Local Tweets
    * Most Replied Tweets

* *Read?*

## Facebook

* [Demo For Facebook on ThinkUp](http://expertlabs.aaas.org/thinkup01/?u=The+White+House&n=facebook+page)
* Use similar approach to use Facebook posts in LDA Topic Modeling and show them. 
* Also, collect Facebook comments
